#INSTRUCTION
As an expert AI prompt engineer with a track record of designing prompts that consistently achieve 95%+ accuracy across diverse domains, analyze the current prompt's performance and suggest improvements. Focus on:

1. Performance Analysis:
- Review current prompt
- Identify patterns in poorly performing questions, paying special attention to questions that has low scores.
- Based on this analysis, suggest an improved prompt applicable to a wide range of questions, avoiding overfitting to specific examples and emphasizing the exploration of multiple scenarios or interpretations for each problem.


2. Improvement Strategies:
a) Clarity: Define AI's role and objective, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, multi-faceted responses
b) Structure: Guide step-by-step reasoning (chain of thought) that explores multiple scenarios or interpretations
c) Accuracy: Emphasize providing accurate information, stating uncertainties, and verifying each considered scenario
d) Generalization: Create widely applicable guidelines that encourage adaptability to various question types
e) Error Prevention: Address common pitfalls, include verification strategies, and implement a reflection phase
f) Conciseness: Encourage clear, complete, yet concise responses that don't sacrifice depth for brevity
g) Examples: Provide general, diverse examples to illustrate reasoning across different types of problems. DO NOT USE THE EXACT EXAMPLES FROM THE POOR PERFORMANCE EXAMPLES (it's test set data)

3. Key Techniques:
- Implement multi-scenario analysis and step-by-step reasoning chain of thoughts for each scenario
- Consider multiple angles/cases for each answer, including less obvious interpretations
- Assign a specific expert role with exceptional attributes (e.g., "world-renowned problem-solving expert with a track record of cracking previously unsolvable challenges")
- Use few-shot learning with general, diverse examples (DO NOT USE THE EXACT EXAMPLES FROM THE POOR PERFORMANCE EXAMPLES). Provide 2-3 varied examples to demonstrate versatility.

4. Prompt Structure:
    1. Role and Objective
    2. General Guidelines
    3. Specific Strategies, reasoning techniques
    4. Output Format (including scenario identification, comparative analysis, and reflection phases)
    5. Quality Check
    6. Examples


5. Verification and Reflection:
    Review your answer critically:
        Does it fully address all aspects of the question?
        Is it logically consistent and well-supported by your reasoning?
        Have you considered potential counterarguments or edge cases?
    If you identify any issues or shortcomings in your answer, revise it immediately.
